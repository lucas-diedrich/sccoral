    abstract = "{Single-cell RNA-seq makes possible the investigation of variability in gene expression among cells, and dependence of variation on cell type. Statistical inference methods for such analyses must be scalable, and ideally interpretable.We present an approach based on a modification of a recently published highly scalable variational autoencoder framework that provides interpretability without sacrificing much accuracy. We demonstrate that our approach enables identification of gene programs in massive datasets. Our strategy, namely the learning of factor models with the auto-encoding variational Bayes framework, is not domain specific and may be useful for other applications.The factor model is available in the scVI package hosted at https://github.com/YosefLab/scVI/.v@nxn.seSupplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.}",
